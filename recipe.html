					<h3>Boiling eggs is a lost art</h3>
						<ol class="boiling_eggs">
							<li>Place enough water in the saucepan so that the eggs will be fully immersed while boiling. Bring the water to a boil.</li>
							<li>Once water is boiling, reduce heat to a simmer and place the eggs into the saucepan. Cover and let the eggs heat for 15-20 mins.</li>
							<li>When eggs are sufficiently heated, drain the water, remove the eggs and place them in a bowl with cold water and ice. Eggs can then either be placed in the fridge or freezer <span>- not too long!</span> - to cool them down before peeling.</li>
							<li>Gently crack the eggs and peel them. Give them a rinse to ensure all shell and peels are removed.</li>

					<h3>Mixing time</h3>
						<ol class="mix">
							<li>Cut the eggs from pole to pole, remove the yolk and place yolks in mixing bowl. Set empty white aside.</li>
							<li>Add the mayonnaise and mustard to the mixing bowl.</li>
							<li>With a spoon, mix the ingredients in the bowl until smooth.
							<li>The mash can either be placed into a <span>Ziploc</span> bag with a corner cut to squeeze back on top of the egg whites. Or, just use a spoon and be careful.</li>
							<li>Once the mash is all finished, dash some paprika, chives or fresh herbs of your choice on top of the eggs.</li>
							<li>Place in a bowl or plate, cover and let sit in the fridge for an hour or so to allow eggs to get cold.</li>
